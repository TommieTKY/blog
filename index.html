        <h2>Canadian Souvenirs</h2>
        <h3>Date: October 8, 2024</h3>

        <p>Canada is famous for its maple trees and leaves, which is why there are so many maple-related products.
        Therefore, I would like to introduce two maple products to you as the Canadian souvenirs.</p>
        
        <div><img src="image/maple_cookies.jpg" alt="This is the photo of maple cookies." height="200"></div>
        <p>First up is maple cookies, which are maple-flavored cookies:</p>        
        <p>Dare Maple Cookie: Sweetness is just right! Subtle maple flavor, mildly sweet and easy to eat! Overall, very tasty!</p>        
        <p>Mr. Maple: Delicious! Not too sweet, with a unique maple aftertaste.</p>        
        <p>Leclerc Maple Leaf Cookie: Too sweet! Smells like McDonald's syrup, and tastes like the cream on a thumbprint cookie.</p>
        <p>Peek Freans Maple Leaf Cookie: Way too sweet! So sweet it made me feel sick.</p>
                
        <div><img src="image/maple_tea.jpg" alt="This is the photo of maple leaf tea." height="200"></div>
        <p>The second one is Maple tea. It turns out that the so-called "maple leaf tea" is actually black tea, green tea, or herbal tea with added maple
        flavor, not real maple leaves. Also, it's recommended to drink it soon after opening, as the maple aroma fades over time. The brand to look for is
        CANADA TRUE. </p> 
        <p>Black Tea: Tastes good, with a noticeable maple aftertaste.</p>        
        <p>Green Tea: It’s okay, but the bitterness of the green tea stands out.</p>        
        <p>Herbal Tea: After sitting for a while, the maple flavor became faint, and the herbal notes were more prominent. Personally, I find it acceptable.
        A friend tried it and mentioned it had a maple aroma, but no sweetness when drinking it, which felt quite contradictory.
        Hmm… maybe it could work as a diet tea?</p>
        <p>If you have any other suggestions, please leave a comment to let me know!</p>
